This is a project to gain more experience with FPGA design and Verilog. In this project, I am making a simple CPU core with a custom ISA. I explore various topics, such as Finite State Machines, Latency Management, 
as well as design tools such as the Vivado Design Suite, IP Cores, and Simulations

Once functionality is complete, I plan on writing an assembler for ease of testing/usage, and then from there optimize the CPU for speed.
