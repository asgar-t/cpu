This is a project to gain more experience with FPGA design/Verilog and Computer Architecture. In this project, I am making a simple CPU core with a custom ISA. I explore various topics, such as Finite State Machines, Latency Management, AXI-S protocol
as well as design tools such as the Vivado Design Suite, IP Cores, and Simulations

Once functionality is complete, I plan on writing an assembler for ease of testing/usage, and then from there optimize the CPU for speed. In addition, I plan to add
features such as interrupts, and peripheral compatibility (keyboard and monitor)
